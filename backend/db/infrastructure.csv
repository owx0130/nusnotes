Data Center News Roundup: HPE Acquires Juniper, Malaysia Growth Vision | Data Center Knowledge | News and analysis for the data center industry;;https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/networks/data-center-news-roundup-hpe-acquires-juniper-malaysia-embarks-growth-vision;;Data Center Knowledge, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Juniper Networks, Malaysia, Singapore;;Yes;;Data Center Knowledge provides a weekly news roundup for industry professionals to stay updated on important stories in the data center industry. Analysts' predictions of mergers in 2024 are coming true as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company agrees to buy Juniper Networks for $14 billion, expanding their presence in the networking technology sector. Malaysia and Singapore have signed a memorandum of understanding for a special economic zone in Johor to boost economic growth. The Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone aims to boost Johor's growth by focusing on tech, medical equipment, food processing, and data center markets. The completion of the RTS Link Project will further enhance the region's data center industry. The emergence of "AI factories," data centers focused on a single application by a single customer, is discussed. These data centers process data, train models, and generate AI, and may become necessary as demand for digital infrastructure increases. Data center providers are expanding their facilities in Frankfurt, Germany and Stockholm, Sweden, while Reliance Industries and Brookfield are opening a new data center in Chennai, India. Eight global data center operators have formed the Asia-Pacific Data Centre Association (APDCA) to advocate for policies and regulations that support the sustainable growth of the data center industry in the region. The APDCA represents the collective interests of data center operators, suppliers, and other stakeholders. The text also touches on server rack sizes, world chip sales growth, Nvidia's new chips for AI, and the impact of AI adoption on IT skill development.
NEC Completes Key India Submarine Cable | SubTel Forum;;https://subtelforum.com/nec-completes-key-india-submarine-cable/;;NEC Corporation India, NEC Corporation, Indian government, Digital India Mission, Lakshadweep Islands;;Yes;;NEC Corporation India and NEC Corporation have successfully completed a submarine cable system connecting Kochi and the Lakshadweep Islands in Southern India. This project, developed under the Indian government's 'Digital India' Mission, aims to provide comprehensive internet connectivity to the Lakshadweep islands, promoting socio-economic growth and aligning with the Digital India Mission. The system offers ample bandwidth for voice and data connectivity, supporting e-Governance initiatives and facilitating e-commerce facilities. It also aids knowledge sharing in educational institutes and provides electronic access to Government services. NEC Corporation expresses gratitude to the Indian government and the people of the Lakshadweep Islands for their support.

Don't Leave Me Stranded: The Risk of Unused Data Center Assets | Data Center Knowledge | News and analysis for the data center industry;;https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/industry-perspectives/dont-leave-me-stranded-risk-unused-data-center-assets;;Data centers, High-Performance Computing (HPC), sustainability measures, inefficient servers, cooling capacity;;Yes;;Data centers, especially those handling High-Performance Computing (HPC), face the challenge of delivering the required output while considering economic viability and environmental needs. These facilities are at risk of becoming stranded assets if they no longer meet capacity requirements, are not economically viable, or fail to contribute to sustainability measures. Data centers often have older, inefficient servers that continue to use power and cooling resources even when they are no longer being used. Inadequate cooling in data centers can lead to increased costs, reduced efficiency, and environmental concerns. Stranded cooling capacity, such as wasted energy and cooling unnecessary equipment, is a costly problem. The text highlights the importance of releasing stranded capacity to improve energy efficiency and reduce costs. Conducting thorough assessments and considering scalability, energy efficiency, and technology obsolescence are crucial to avoid becoming a stranded asset. Data center monitoring software is recommended to identify and eliminate wasted energy. Various ways to increase energy savings in data centers are discussed, including increasing supply air temperature, decreasing supply airflow rate, removing server waste, consolidating under-utilized ITE, and using colocation or cloud-based solutions. The goal is to minimize the risk of stranded assets and ensure the sustainability and economic viability of the industry.
